31 — Provider Scaffolding & Real Provider Onboarding
Scaffold-Only State Policy + The Path to Real Providers, by Provider Type
STATUS: AUTHORITATIVE (V3)
AUTHORED_BY_TASK: T-DOC-004
SOURCES (V2, now SUPERSEDED):
- final_docs_v2/23_AI_PROVIDERS_SCAFFOLDING_POLICY.md   (scaffold-only state policy)
- final_docs_v2/25_REAL_PROVIDER_ONBOARDING_GUIDE.md    (real provider onboarding guide)
AUTHORITY SWITCH: final_docs_v3/00_INDEX.md (MIGRATION STATUS table)
RELATED AUTHORITATIVE SPEC:
- final_docs_v3/30_PROVIDER_ARCHITECTURE_AND_PLUGIN_SPEC.md (provider architecture, contracts, capability model)
This document is the single authority for the provider lifecycle stage question:
"No real providers exist yet — what now, and how do real providers get added later?"
Part I defines the scaffold-only state policy (what must and must not exist before any real provider).
Part II defines the onboarding guide (how to add real providers later, by provider type).
PART I — SCAFFOLD-ONLY STATE POLICY
1. Purpose and Current State — Important
This policy defines what the Agent must do when the project does not yet contain real AI provider implementations.
The goal is to avoid blocking the architecture while also avoiding fake, invented, or misleading provider integrations.
At the current documentation/repository state:
There are NO real AI providers implemented yet.
Any provider-related structure described in the documentation is currently intended as:
architecture
contracts
schemas
templates
examples
scaffolding
future implementation guide
It must not be interpreted as working provider integration.
2. Core Rule
If no real ai_providers exist yet:
Create provider structure and contracts only.
Do not invent working providers.
Do not claim provider integration is complete.
Do not hardcode provider-specific behavior into Core.
Real providers will be added later.
3. Required Behavior
When the Agent inspects the repo and finds:
no ai_providers directory
or
no real provider implementations
or
only incomplete/unknown provider files
it must:
1. Create the provider framework/scaffold.
2. Create provider contracts/interfaces.
3. Create manifest schemas.
4. Create registry structure.
5. Create common error/capability types.
6. Create disabled template providers for diverse provider categories.
7. Add tests that validate the scaffold, not fake provider behavior.
8. Record that real providers are pending.
4. Forbidden
The Agent must not:
pretend a provider works
invent API endpoints
invent credentials
invent rate limits
invent model names as real
mark templates as active
write provider-specific logic in Core
skip the provider architecture because real providers are missing
block the whole project waiting for providers
5. Recommended Directory Structure
If absent, create a structure similar to:
providers/
├── README.md
├── registry/
│   ├── provider_registry_contract.*
│   ├── model_binding_registry_contract.*
│   └── capability_registry_contract.*

│       ├── errors.*
│       └── tests/
└── _pending_real_providers.md
Exact language and file extensions depend on the project stack.
If the project chooses a different code layout, the same boundaries must remain.
6. Diversity Requirement
Even without real providers, the scaffold must account for provider diversity.
Template categories should cover at least:
1. Chat/Text generation
2. Reasoning-heavy model
3. Coding model
4. Vision input model
5. Image generation model
6. Speech-to-text / audio input
7. Text-to-speech / audio output
8. Embeddings
9. Reranking / retrieval support
10. Moderation / safety
11. Multimodal model
12. Provider-native agent / assistant / code agent
These are templates only. They must be disabled and clearly marked as non-functional.
7. Template Manifest Requirements
Every template provider must include a manifest with:
id: template_chat_text_provider
name: Template Chat/Text Provider
status: template_disabled
is_template: true
is_functional: false
real_provider_required: true

capabilities:
  chat: true
  reasoning: false
  coding: false
  vision_input: false
  image_generation: false
  audio_input: false
  audio_output: false
  embeddings: false
  rerank: false
  moderation: false
  provider_agent: false

auth:
  types: []

models:
  discovery: not_implemented

notes:
  - This is a scaffold template only.
  - Do not activate without a real provider adapter and contract tests.
8. Provider-Native Agent Template
Because some providers may expose agent-like models, include a disabled template:
id: template_provider_agent_provider
name: Template Provider-Native Agent Provider
status: template_disabled
is_template: true
is_functional: false

capabilities:
  provider_agent: true
  tool_use: true
  files: true

agent_module:
  supported: true
  type: provider_agent_template
  state_model: unknown
  supports_provider_tools: unknown
  supports_platform_tools: false
  provider_managed_state: unknown

security:
  provider_side_tools_allowed_by_default: false
  requires_capability_firewall: true
  requires_evaluation: true
  requires_audit: true
This template exists only to preserve architecture support for future provider-native agents.
9. Pending Providers File
Create or maintain:
providers/_pending_real_providers.md
Canonical content (merged from both V2 sources):
# Pending Real Providers

No real AI providers are implemented yet.

## Required before activation / before adding any provider
- Choose provider type.
- Real provider API/auth details
- Capability discovery / document capabilities
- Model list or discovery method
- Define operations
- Credential handling
- Rate limit behavior
- Error mapping
- Health checks
- Contract tests
- Security review

## Candidate provider categories
- Chat/Text (API key text/chat)
- Reasoning
- Coding
- OAuth provider
- Session/cookie website provider
- Vision (input)
- Image generation
- Audio STT
- Audio TTS
- Embeddings
- Rerank
- Moderation
- Multimodal
- Provider-native agent
10. Registry Behavior With Templates
Template providers must not appear as active provider candidates.
Router and registry rules:
template_disabled providers are excluded from routing
is_functional=false providers are excluded from execution
real_provider_required=true providers cannot pass health checks
The registry may load templates only for schema validation, docs, and scaffolding tests.
11. Tests Required For Scaffold-Only State
If only scaffold/templates exist, tests should verify:
manifest schema validation
templates are disabled
templates are excluded from routing
templates cannot execute generation
template health check returns non-functional
diverse capability categories are represented
provider contract can be implemented later
Core does not import provider internals
Do not write tests that pretend generation works.
12. Scaffold Must Not Force One Provider Shape
When creating provider scaffolding, do not design templates as if every provider has:
registration
session refresh
account pool
generic generate
chat model
streaming
files
agent behavior
The scaffold must be capability-driven.
Templates should show diversity of provider shapes:
API-key provider
OAuth provider
session/cookie provider
no-auth local/internal provider
text-only provider
image-only provider
embeddings-only provider
moderation-only provider
multimodal provider
provider-native agent provider
Each template must mark unsupported modules as not implemented or not applicable, not as TODOs that imply mandatory work.
Example:
account_registration:
  required: false
  supported: false
  reason: api_key_provider

session_refresh:
  required: false
  supported: false

generation_operations:
  text_generation: true
  image_generation: false
  embeddings: false
  provider_agent: false
The Core should depend on declared capabilities, not on a fixed provider lifecycle.
13. Interaction With MVP
For MVP, it is acceptable to start with:
Provider framework + templates only
if real provider details are not ready.
But MVP cannot claim end-to-end AI execution until at least one real provider is implemented and verified.
14. Resume Handling During Scaffolding Work
If a session is interrupted while creating provider scaffolding:
1. Resume from Git.
2. Inspect providers/ directory.
3. Inspect templates and manifests.
4. Verify no template is active.
5. Run scaffold validation tests if available.
6. Update progress state.
7. Continue with the smallest missing scaffold piece.
If progress state was not updated, reconstruct from:
Git diff
providers/ files
manifest validation
scaffold tests
15. Scaffold-State Final Rule
Missing real providers should not block architecture progress.
No providers yet → build safe diverse scaffold.
Real providers later → implement via contracts.
Never fake provider functionality.
Never contaminate Core with provider-specific shortcuts.
PART II — REAL PROVIDER ONBOARDING GUIDE
16. What Exists Now
The expected current provider work is only:
Provider contracts
Provider manifest schema
Provider registry structure
Capability definitions
Error normalization rules
Health contracts
Disabled provider templates
Pending real providers list
Onboarding guide for future real providers
17. What Must Not Be Claimed Yet
Until at least one real provider is implemented and tested, the project must not claim:
real AI execution works
real chat generation works
real image generation works
real account pool works
real provider auth works
real provider fallback works
real model discovery works
real provider-agent execution works
The project may only claim:
provider architecture/scaffold exists
provider contracts exist
provider templates exist
real providers can be added later via the guide
18. Template vs Real Provider
Template Provider
A template provider is documentation/scaffold only.
status: template_disabled
is_template: true
is_functional: false
real_provider_required: true
It must be excluded from:
routing
execution
health success
model availability
production use
Real Provider
A real provider is an implemented and verified integration.
status: active | disabled | maintenance
is_template: false
is_functional: true
real_provider_required: false
It may be used only after passing required contract/security tests.
19. Universal Real Provider Onboarding Checklist
For every real provider, regardless of type:
1. Identify provider type and auth method.
2. Document real capabilities.
3. Create real manifest.
4. Implement only declared operations.
5. Implement credential handling without plaintext secrets.
6. Implement health check.
7. Implement error normalization.
8. Implement rate/limit behavior if known.
9. Add contract tests for each declared capability.
10. Add security checks for secrets and tenant isolation.
11. Register provider in Provider Registry.
12. Register model/provider bindings if models exist.
13. Keep provider disabled until tests pass.
14. Enable via Admin/Config only after verification.

21. Activation Requirements — Template → Real Provider
A template can become a real provider only after:
real manifest completed
adapter implemented
auth/credential handling implemented
model discovery or static bindings implemented
generation implemented where applicable
error normalization implemented
health checks implemented
contract tests pass
security review completed
admin enablement configured
Then status may change from:
template_disabled
to:
active | disabled | maintenance
22. Real Provider Activation Checklist
A provider can be enabled only when:
manifest is real, not template
capabilities are verified
credential handling is secure
operations implemented only for declared capabilities
contract tests pass
health check works
errors are normalized
rate/limit behavior handled
secrets are not logged
admin config enables provider
router sees provider as eligible only when healthy
23. Final Rule
Until a real provider is implemented:
Examples are examples.
Templates are templates.
Scaffold is scaffold.
No real execution is claimed.
When adding a real provider:
declare real capabilities
implement only those capabilities
verify with contract tests
keep Core provider-agnostic
activate only after admin/security approval
