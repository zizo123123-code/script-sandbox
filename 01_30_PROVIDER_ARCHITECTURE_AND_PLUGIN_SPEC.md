30 — Provider Architecture and Plugin Specification
Capability-Driven Providers, Plugin Contracts, Optional Account Pools, and Safe Scaffolding
V3 STATUS: AUTHORITATIVE
SOURCES: final_docs_v2/24_FINAL_PROVIDER_ARCHITECTURE_SPEC.md (base)
         final_docs_v2/05_PROVIDER_PLUGIN_SPEC.md (detail)
MERGED_BY_TASK: T-DOC-003
Purpose
This is the single authoritative specification for the Provider subsystem:
provider philosophy, plugin contracts, manifests, interfaces, account pools,
health, error normalization, provider-native agents, tests, and activation.
Audience
Implementation Agents building the provider framework or onboarding providers.
Reviewers verifying provider isolation and contract compliance.
Authoritative Content
Provider subsystem rules and boundaries (this file wins over any other doc).
Plugin contract: manifest schema, required/optional interfaces.
Account pool, lease, health, rate-limit, and error-normalization contracts.
Provider-native agent rules.
Scaffold-only state rules. Onboarding steps by provider type live in
31_PROVIDER_SCAFFOLDING_AND_ONBOARDING.md (until created:
final_docs_v2/23_AI_PROVIDERS_SCAFFOLDING_POLICY.md + 25_REAL_PROVIDER_ONBOARDING_GUIDE.md).
1. Final Provider Philosophy
A Provider is not a small send_request() adapter.
Providers are internally independent.
Providers are externally normalized through contracts.
Providers are capability-driven.
Providers do not all share one lifecycle.
The Core never depends on provider-specific behavior.
A Provider is a provider-specific module that may contain its own:
request runtime
auth logic
account lifecycle
session handling
discovery
model binding
operations
assets
limits
errors
health
provider-native agents
But the Core sees only:
Provider Contract
Capabilities
Health
Normalized operations
Normalized errors
Normalized results
2. Non-Negotiable Boundaries
Core must not import provider internals.
Core must not know provider HTTP flow.
Core must not know provider cookies/session mechanics.
Core must not store provider secrets directly.
Core must not assume all providers support generation.
Core must not assume all providers have accounts.
Core must not assume all providers have models.
Core must not assume all providers work the same way.
Additionally forbidden:
Router calls provider HTTP directly.
Provider writes secrets to logs.
Provider bypasses account leasing.
Provider hardcodes global policy.
Provider assumes all users can use it.
Provider changes normalized contracts without versioning.
3. Four Concepts Must Stay Separate
The architecture must always separate:
Model
Provider
Account
Credential
Example:
Model:      claude-opus-like-model
Providers:  provider_a, provider_b, provider_c
Account:    provider_b_account_17
Credential: credential_ref_for_account_17
This enables:
same model across multiple providers
multiple accounts per provider
user-owned credentials separated from platform credentials
provider failover without changing model identity
account failover without changing provider identity
4. Providers Are Capability-Driven
A provider declares what it supports. The platform must not force every
provider to implement registration, login, session refresh, account pools,
generic generate, chat, streaming, file upload, or agent behavior.
4.1 Common Minimum Required For Every Provider
Every real or template provider must define:
provider identity
manifest
status
capabilities declaration
supported modalities
auth/credential policy declaration
health contract
error normalization contract
contract tests for declared capabilities
This minimum allows the Core, Router, Admin, and Evaluation systems to
reason about the provider safely.
4.2 Optional Modules By Capability
Module	Required Only When
account_registration	Provider supports/needs account creation
login/authenticate	Provider requires login/session auth
session_refresh	Provider uses expiring sessions/cookies/tokens
account_pool	Platform manages multiple accounts for provider
api_key_validation	Provider uses API keys
oauth_flow	Provider uses OAuth
text_generation	Provider supports text/chat generation
image_generation	Provider supports image generation
vision_input	Provider accepts image/file input
audio_stt	Provider supports speech-to-text
audio_tts	Provider supports text-to-speech
embeddings	Provider supports embeddings
rerank	Provider supports reranking
moderation	Provider supports safety/moderation
file_upload	Provider accepts assets/files
streaming	Provider supports streaming output
async_jobs	Provider uses job/poll/result flow
provider_agent	Provider exposes native agent/assistant/code-agent behavior
4.3 Forbidden Assumptions
The Agent implementing providers must not assume:
every provider needs registration
every provider needs session refresh
every provider needs account pool
every provider can chat
every provider can generate text
every provider supports streaming
every provider has models
every provider is stateless
every provider can be called the same way
Provider behavior must be discovered, declared, tested, and isolated.
5. Generation Is Not One Universal Method
Do not force all providers into one generate() implementation.
Provider operations are capability-specific:
generate_text
generate_image
transcribe_audio
synthesize_speech
create_embeddings
rerank_documents
moderate_content
analyze_vision
run_provider_agent
upload_asset
download_asset
A provider implements only the operations it declares.
If an operation is not declared:
Provider is ineligible for that task.
6. Provider Package Structure
6.1 Minimal Plugin Layout
providers/<provider_key>/
  manifest.yaml
  adapter.ts|py
  auth.ts|py
  accounts.ts|py
  models.ts|py
  generate.ts|py
  assets.ts|py
  health.ts|py
  errors.ts|py
  tests/
Exact language/layout may vary, but boundaries must remain.
6.2 Mature Provider Layout (Optional Growth Path)
providers/<provider_key>/
├── manifest.yaml
├── provider.*
├── config.*
├── client.*
│
├── runtime/
│   ├── request.*
│   ├── session.*
│   ├── auth.*
│   ├── parser.*
│   └── errors.*
│
├── account/
│   ├── manager.*
│   ├── create.*
│   ├── refresh.*
│   ├── validate.*

│   ├── cooldown.*
│   └── health.*
│
├── provider_health/

└── errors.*
This is not mandatory for every provider from day one. Small providers may
implement fewer files as long as they satisfy the common contract and
declared capabilities.
7. Provider Manifest

    - time_window

health:
  checks:
    - auth_valid
    - endpoint_available
    - quota_available

errors:
  mapping: provider_x_error_map
8. Provider Interfaces
8.1 Required Provider Interface
interface ProviderAdapter {
  getManifest(): ProviderManifest;
  validateCredential(credentialRef: string): Promise<CredentialHealth>;
  discoverModels(account?: ProviderAccount): Promise<ModelBinding[]>;
  getCapabilities(): Promise<ProviderCapabilities>;
  generate(request: ProviderGenerateRequest): Promise<ProviderGenerateResponse>;
  healthCheck(scope: HealthScope): Promise<ProviderHealth>;
  normalizeError(error: unknown): ProviderError;
}
Note: generate here is the normalized entry point; internally it dispatches
to the capability-specific operations of Section 5. A provider without a
generation capability rejects generation with unsupported_capability.
8.2 Optional Interfaces
interface ProviderAccountLifecycle {
  createAccount?(): Promise<ProviderAccount>;
  refreshAccount?(account: ProviderAccount): Promise<AccountRefreshResult>;
  disableAccount?(accountId: string): Promise<void>;
}

interface ProviderAssets {
  uploadFile?(file: FileRef): Promise<AssetRef>;
  downloadFile?(asset: AssetRef): Promise<FileRef>;
}
Provider agent interfaces are defined in Section 15.
9. Provider Runtime
Provider Runtime hides provider-specific request mechanics. It may handle:
HTTP verbs
headers
cookies
sessions
CSRF
token injection
custom signatures
timeouts
retry
pagination
polling
async job status
downloads
response parsing
provider-specific error parsing
The Core must not see these details.
10. Accounts, Pools, and Credentials
10.1 Account Pool Is Optional
Provider without Account Pool (e.g. simple API-key provider, embeddings
provider, moderation provider, internal/local provider) may only need:
credential validation
health check
operation implementation
Provider with Account Pool (e.g. session-based provider, website provider,
provider with per-account rate limits or multiple platform-managed accounts)
may need:
account lifecycle
usage tracking
cooldown
lease
selection
refresh
health
10.2 Account Lifecycle States
When account lifecycle exists, use normalized states:
PENDING
READY
IN_USE
COOLDOWN
REFRESH_REQUIRED
AUTH_EXPIRED
RATE_LIMITED
VERIFICATION_REQUIRED
INVALID
DISABLED
These states describe account usability, not provider availability.
10.3 Account Selection Rules
Core asks Account Pool Manager for an eligible account.
Eligibility filters:
provider active
credential active
account lifecycle READY
not in cooldown
tenant/user policy allows it
rate limit budget available
model binding available
Selection may consider:
least recently used
available quota
health
latency
error rate
priority
owner policy
10.4 Account Lease For Concurrency
If a provider uses account pools, concurrent execution must use leases:
eligible accounts
↓
select account
↓
acquire lease
↓
execute provider operation
↓
update usage/state
↓
release lease
This prevents many requests from using the same account unsafely.
10.5 Credential Ownership
platform_owned
user_owned
tenant_owned
Never mix platform and user credentials in one account pool.
Policy values:
platform_only
user_only
prefer_user
auto
11. Health
Provider health is separate from account health.
Provider-wide states:
HEALTHY
DEGRADED
UNAVAILABLE
SUSPENDED
Account-level states:
READY
COOLDOWN
AUTH_EXPIRED
INVALID
Do not confuse one account failed with the whole provider is down.
12. Rate Limits Are Provider-Specific
Do not use one global rate-limit model. A provider may limit by:
request count
tokens
images
audio minutes
concurrency
endpoint
account
model
time window
daily quota
provider response headers
The provider translates its real limits into normalized state:
available
limited
cooldown_until
unknown
13. Provider Selection and Failure Handling
13.1 Provider Selection Flow
When a model can be served by multiple providers:
Core request
↓
Model Registry
↓
Provider bindings for model
↓
Provider Health Filter
↓
Policy selection: random / weighted / least-used / priority
↓
Provider selected
↓
Account Pool if needed
↓
Provider Runtime
↓
Normalized result
For explicit model requests, provider selection should prefer healthy
eligible providers for the same model before falling back to other models.
13.2 Failure Handling
Account failure:
account rate limited → mark COOLDOWN → try another account
account auth expired → REFRESH_REQUIRED / AUTH_EXPIRED
account invalid → INVALID / DISABLED
Provider failure:
provider errors/timeouts increase
provider health degrades
circuit breaker opens
router skips provider temporarily
All providers for an explicit model fail — fallback depends on policy:
same_model_different_provider
same_tier_auto
fail_if_fallback_disabled
admin-defined chain
14. Error Normalization
Provider-specific errors must be normalized into common categories:
auth_expired
invalid_credential
rate_limited
quota_exceeded
model_unavailable
provider_unavailable
unsupported_capability
bad_request
content_rejected
timeout
retryable_server_error
non_retryable_error
Each normalized error must include:
{
  "category": "rate_limited",
  "retryable": true,
  "retry_after_ms": 30000,
  "provider_code": "raw-code",
  "safe_message": "Provider rate limit reached."
}
The Core makes decisions from normalized errors only.
15. Provider-Native Agents
Some providers expose agent-like capabilities:
assistant API
code agent
research agent
tool-using model
managed thread/run
Represent this as the provider_agent capability.
Binding rule:
Provider Agent Capability != Platform Agent Runtime
The platform may use provider agents as sub-agents/nodes, while the platform
still owns:
authorization
capability firewall
tool approval
tenant isolation
usage accounting
evaluation
audit
final response
15.1 Manifest Extension
capabilities:
  chat: true
  reasoning: true
  tool_use: true
  provider_agent: true

agent_module:
  supported: true
  type: managed_assistant
  state_model: thread_run
  supports_files: true
  supports_provider_tools: true
  supports_platform_tools: false
  supports_streaming: true
  max_steps: null
  approval_integration: required
15.2 Provider Agent Interface
interface ProviderAgentModule {
  runAgent?(request: ProviderAgentRequest): Promise<ProviderAgentResponse>;
  createAgentRun?(request: ProviderAgentRunRequest): Promise<ProviderAgentRun>;
  getAgentRun?(runId: string): Promise<ProviderAgentRunStatus>;
  cancelAgentRun?(runId: string): Promise<void>;
  streamAgentRun?(runId: string): AsyncIterable<ProviderAgentEvent>;
}
15.3 Event Normalization
Provider-specific agent behavior must be normalized into platform events:
provider_agent.started
provider_agent.step_started
provider_agent.tool_requested
provider_agent.tool_completed
provider_agent.message_delta
provider_agent.completed
provider_agent.failed
The platform must not expose raw provider agent semantics directly to the
rest of the Core.
15.4 Security Rule
Even if the provider agent can use tools internally, it must not bypass
platform security. Required controls:
provider agent tools must be declared
provider-side tool use must be policy-controlled
platform tools still require Capability Firewall
write actions require approval where configured
provider-managed state must be tenant-scoped
provider agent traces must be auditable
15.5 Usage Rule
A provider agent may be used as:
1. a normal model candidate with provider_agent capability
2. a node inside a platform Execution Graph
3. a specialist role inside Agent Mode
4. a fallback candidate for complex tasks if policy allows
But it must not replace the platform's routing, authorization, evaluation,
or audit layers.
15.6 Multiple Provider Agents as Platform Sub-Agents
A provider may expose more than one agent-like capability:
provider_x.code_agent
provider_x.research_agent
provider_x.image_agent
provider_x.review_agent
Each must be registered independently with:
id
type
capabilities
modalities
state model
tool behavior
risk level
allowed roles
required controls
The platform Agent may orchestrate several provider agents from one or many
providers inside one Execution Graph. Provider modules must expose enough
metadata for routing, safety, evaluation, and usage accounting.
16. Provider Shape Examples
API-key text provider:
needs api_key_validation
needs text_generation
may not need account_registration / session_refresh / account_pool
Session-based website provider:
may need login/session_refresh
may need account_pool
may need cooldown/rate-limit management
may support text_generation or multimodal generation
Embeddings-only provider:
needs embeddings
does not need chat/text generation or agent module
Image-only provider:
needs image_generation
may need asset handling
does not need text chat generation
Provider-native agent provider:
needs provider_agent capability
may need provider-managed thread/run state
may need files/tools policy
must still pass platform Capability Firewall and evaluation
17. Current State: No Real Providers Exist Yet
No real providers are implemented yet.
Templates and examples are non-functional until replaced by real
implementations and contract tests.
If no real ai_providers exist:
build scaffold only
create contracts
create manifest schema
create registry structure
create disabled diverse templates
create pending providers file
do not fake provider functionality
The Agent must not invent working providers, fake model names, fake
credentials, or provider-specific Core shortcuts.
17.1 Template Diversity — Scaffold Must Not Force One Shape
Template diversity must include the categories:
chat/text, reasoning, coding, vision, image generation,
audio STT, audio TTS, embeddings, rerank, moderation/safety,
multimodal, provider-native agent
and demonstrate diverse shapes:
API-key provider
OAuth provider
session/cookie provider
no-auth local/internal provider
text-only / image-only / embeddings-only / moderation-only provider
multimodal provider
provider-native agent provider
All templates must be disabled:
status: template_disabled
is_template: true
is_functional: false
Unsupported modules must be marked
not_supported / not_applicable / not_implemented_for_template,
not as mandatory TODOs.
Scaffolding policy and real onboarding steps by provider type:
31_PROVIDER_SCAFFOLDING_AND_ONBOARDING.md (until created, use
final_docs_v2/23_AI_PROVIDERS_SCAFFOLDING_POLICY.md and
final_docs_v2/25_REAL_PROVIDER_ONBOARDING_GUIDE.md).
18. Tests Required
